1. Create class Person that does not have a main method
2. Add two fields - 
      String variable named name
      Integer variable named age
3. Create class PersonDemo that has a main method
4. In main method create variable a of type Person like so:
      "Person a = new Person();
      (We will explain later what the significance of this statement is)
5. Assign a string "Bob" to the name field of a
6. Assign integer 25 to age field of a
7. In main create another variable b of type Person as we did in Step 4
8. Assign string "Mary" to name field of b
9. Assign integer 35 to age field of b
10. Back in Person class define two methods:
       public void SayName() {
          System.out.println("My name is " + name + " and my age is " + age);
       }
       public void HaveBirthday() {
          age++;
       }
11. Back in PersonDemo class, invoke SayName method and HaveBirthday method using a
12. Invoke SayName and HaveBirthday method using b
13. Invoke SayName for a and then for b (notice their ages have changed)
