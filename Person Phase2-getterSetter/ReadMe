1. In Person class modify the fields name and age to be private
2. In Person class define four new methods:
      public void setName(String name) {
          this.name = name;
      }
      public String getName() {
          return name;
      }
      public void setAge(int age) {
          this.age = age;
      }
      public int getAge() {
          return age;
      }
3. These are called setters and getters
      Setters are used to set the value of a class field
      Getters are used to retrieve the value of a class field
4. Back in PersonDemo change name of a by using its setter method and passing the String "Bob" as an argument
5. Print the value of name by passing the getter method as an argument to S.O.P.
6. Change the age of a using its setter method and passing the int argument 21
7. Print the value of age
